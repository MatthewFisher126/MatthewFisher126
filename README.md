## Hello! 

I am a Data Scientist with a Data Science Masters Degree from University of Colorado, Boulder. Currently I work at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine where I help automate data pipelines and utilize machine learning to discover health disparities among patient groups. 

### Work
- I containerized a bioinformatics tool called (ESCALATOR)[https://github.com/MatthewFisher126/ESCALATOR] which is used for calculating polygenic risk scores so it could be used on various platforms
